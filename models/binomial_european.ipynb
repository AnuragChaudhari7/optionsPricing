    "If we consider the binomial tree to be nodes that can be represented by vectors we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock Price at Node i,j: $$S_i,_j = S_0 \\cdot u^j \\cdot d^{i-j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a European call option. The option contract price is given by $C_{i,j}$. For a given node, the options contract price at that node is given by\n",
    "$$C_{i,j} = max(S_{i,j} - K, 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To hedge the short position, buy $\\beta$ shares of stock. As a result, consider $\\alpha$ amount of money from the monkey market with risk free interest rate r. $\\alpha$ is hence given by $$ \\alpha = C_0 - \\beta S_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are considering a one period binomial model, we consider 2 cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The stock goes up. This leads to this formula: $$C_u = \\alpha \\cdot e^{rT} + \\beta \\cdot S_u$$\n",
    "(2) The stock goes down. This leads to this formula: $$C_d = \\alpha \\cdot e^{rT} + \\beta \\cdot S_d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to neutralise our risk, we want to buy $\\beta$ shares of stock such that we do not lose money regardless of if the stock goes up or down. So we have to say that the portfolio value of our hedge must be equal for both scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence subtracting both equations, we get that we should buy $\\beta$ shares given by: $$\\beta = \\frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting $\\beta$ into either equation (1) or (2) we get the arbitrage price for the European call option with one period: $$ C_0 = e^{-rT}[p C_u + q C_d] $$ \n",
    "where $p = \\frac{e^{rT} - d}{u - d}$ and $q = 1 - p$ which is the risk-neutral probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: $S_u = S_0 \\cdot u$ and $S_d = S_0 \\cdot d$"
